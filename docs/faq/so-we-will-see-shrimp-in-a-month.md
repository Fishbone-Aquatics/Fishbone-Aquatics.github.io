# So can we expect to see the shrimp in a month?

Not quite, for two reasons.

1) We are waiting for a good deal from a reputable buyer - we have a script that will notify us when that time comes.
As an example:

2) We will likely wait 2-3 months prior to putting the shrimp in, presuming we do not end up snagging a deal on them prior to this. These specific shrimp are extremely sensitive to water parameters and changes.
