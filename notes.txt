[INFO] Docusaurus version: 3.7.0
```

The issue is that you are currently on the gh-pages branch, and Docusaurus does not allow deploying from the branch it is deploying to.


Run the following in PowerShell:
`git checkout main`
and then deploy:
`$env:GIT_USER="Fishbone-Aquatics"; $env:DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH="gh-pages"; npm run deploy`



YOU MUST BUILD AND DEPLOY FOR EACH CHANGE AS GITHUB PAGES DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY REBUILD THE STATIC SITE.
LONG VERSION:
git add .
git commit -m "Updated docs"
git push origin main
npm run build
npm run deploy


SHORT VERSION:
npm run build
npm run deploy



TODO: 
learn how to set perm local env variable noob
$env:GIT_USER="Fishbone-Aquatics"; $env:DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH="gh-pages"; npm run deploy


swap to github actions for automated deployments and workflow
